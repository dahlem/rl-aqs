These graphs were generated on the 14th/15th of July using an algorithm
with the following characteristics:
- stochastic preferential attachment to nodes with higher strength (service
  rate)
- the arrival rate is uniformly distributed between 0 and 10
- the number of edges is uniformly distributed between 1 and {2,3,4,5,6}
