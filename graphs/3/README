These graphs were generated on the 24th of July using an algorithm
with the following characteristics:
- stochastic preferential attachment to nodes with higher strength (service
  rate)
- the arrival rate is uniformly distributed between 0 and 10
- the number of edges is uniformly distributed between 10 and 100 to generate
  dense graphs
