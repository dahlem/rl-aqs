Implementation of a high-performance adaptive queueing simulation
environment, which can be configured to run on clusters of computers
using MPI. The underlying simulator is based on advanced data
structures to provide efficient event handling, such as a priority
queue implementation geared towards discrete event simulation
[1]. Decentralised control is implemented using SARSA reinforcement
learning with a neural network function approximator to provide
compact representation of the state space. Details and results of the
research into adaptive queueing systems can be found [2-5].
